/** @mainpage Developer Documentation
 * Welcome to the Devtrac developer's documentation. This documentation
 * is  generated from the code that runs Devtrac and includes 
 * the Devtrac installation profile, the custom modules, the exported features
 * as well as the documentation of all the contrib modules that are used by a
 * plain Devtrac install.
 * 
 * The main documentation and user tutorials can be found on 
 * @link the Devtrac website http://www.devtrac.org/node/20 @endlink
 * 
 * @section main_folders Folder structure
 * 
 * The Devtrac profile is located in /profiles/devtrac and has the following 
 * subfolders:
 * 
 * @subsection main_folders_docs /profiles/devtrac/docs
 * Contains the main documentation of the profile (including this file). If you 
 * want to cover a bigger Devtrac coding subject, please read  * @link devtrac_documentation About the Documentation @endlink before
 * you add files to this folder. 
 * 
 * @subsection main_folders_features /profiles/devtrac/modules/features
 * 
 * The Devtrac distribution makes use of the @link features @endlink module. All 
 * nodetypes, views, search_api indices and as many of the configuration as 
 * possible is a feature.
 * You will find all the features in the /profiles/devtrac/modules/features folder
 * 
 * @subsection main_folders_modules /profiles/devtrac/modules/custom
 * The modules that are too specific for Devtrac are stored here. Some of them
 * we have not found the time yet to abstract them out to become standalone modules
 * which is our general wish. The heart of the Devtrac application is the @link devtrac @endlink module.
 * It contains menus, node_hook implementations, form_alter etc.
